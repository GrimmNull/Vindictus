Vindictus was a little project I wrote while in High School when trying to learn Common Lisp.
This monstrosity isn't necessarily made to be as efficient as possible or as clean as possible, it's made in such a way to use as many Lisp things as possible.
If you actually know Lisp, please stop, don't go any further! If you do though, I'm sorry for what you'll see
